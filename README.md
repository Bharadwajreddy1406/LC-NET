## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Connect from Other Devices:**  
   - Ensure all devices are connected to the same network.  
   - Use the correct local IP address (not `localhost`).  
   - Check for firewall restrictions on the server machine and allow traffic on port `3000`.

- **Slow Performance:**  
   - Ensure a stable network connection.  
   - Limit the number of connected users if required.
